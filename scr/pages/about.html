      <h3>Who does this website belong to?</h3>
      <section id="aboutBody">
        <p><a>Willem Swanepoel</a> or Will Swan for short, is a young and hopeful software developer currently living in <a>Newcastle, Australia</a> where he discovered a passion for programming through the language of <a>Python</a> and he never really forgot. Suffering from undiagnosed ADHD he found improving in the field difficult as he was subject to the whims of his condition. <br> However, due to his father getting diagnosed, it has come to light that <a>Will Swan</a> may aswell be suffering from ADHD. Since getting diagnosed and joining <a>Coder Academy</a> to teach him the ropes of the professional coding environment, his passion is finally being fulfilled.</p>

      <h3>Some facts about Will Swan.</h3>
      <section id="history">
        <ul>
          <li><div>I have been coding on and off since I was 15, having been introduced to it in highschool.</div></li>
          <li><div>Some notible items I've done in Python before lossing the files was a game using the pygame module and producing a Discord Bot to play music in the voice chat function.</div></li>
          <li><div>Other hobbies of mine include playing video games, I enjoy the technical elements being drawn to Redstone Engineering in games like Minecraft, or prefering roles like Sniper or Spy in competive First Person Shooters like TF2 and Halo.</div></li>
          <li><div>While not medicated I am drawn to new things and will often dedicate upwards of 10 hours a day towards something if my ADHD chooses to hyper fixate on it. This however has put a strain on my passion for coding and since getting medicated has allowed me to continue this passion in a much healthier manner without lossing interest after the 2 week period.</div></li>

      <h3>What are Will Swan's skills?</h3>
      <section id="skills">
        <ul>
          <li><div><a>Problem Solving</a> is one of my most defining skills, comboing well with my ADHD, allows for divergent thinking of coming up with solutions not often though of by neurotypical minds</div></li>
          <li><div>Despite my condition I have always been <a>Organised</a> everything always has a place, and I rarely loose items when they are where they belong.</div></li>
          <li><div><a>Creativity</a> is another skill I possess, though not creative in an artistic form, my creativity comes out in my solutions and approach to problems or simply in the ideas I have when making suggestions</div></li>
          <li><div><a>ADHD</a> isn't much a skill than a condition, however through learning to manage and live with it, even while undiagnosed, parts of it have become skills, as demonstrated above, I am <a>dedicated</a> and <a>self motivated</a> to get stuff done in a timely manner, often within the first 2 weeks of being givin the task, my <a>attention to detail</a> is often higher than most as small imperfections bother me, and its become a challange to learn to let things be.</div></li>
